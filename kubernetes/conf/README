1. If you plan to use glusterfs. You need a glusterfs cluster. It is assumed you have 2 endpoint IP addresses for it. From these create the glusterfs.json conf, example:

   make glusterfs.json GLUSTERFS_IP1=192.168.0.149 GLUSTERFS_IP2=192.168.0.248

2. Choose persistent volume method. Makefile provide 2 examples for hostPath and glusterfs.
Generate conf files.

   make conf

3. Run seldon-up.sh from scripts folder. If you need spark or glusterfs you need to add env vars, e.g.
one of:

   seldon-up.sh 
   SELDON_WITH_GLUSTERFS=true seldon-up.sh 
   SELDON_WITH_SPARK=true seldon-up.sh 
   SELDON_WITH_SPARK=true SELDON_WITH_GLUSTERFS=true seldon-up.sh 

4. To add a microservce (TODO)

5. To shut down run seldon-down.sh from scripts folder
