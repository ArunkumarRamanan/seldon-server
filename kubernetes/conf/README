1. Create yml files from templates

For a basic cluster in which the persistent storage is presently handled by hostPath entried run:

make clean td-agent-server.yml mysql.yml control.yml spark-master.yml spark-workers.yml  BASE_PATH=<some base path>

This will create hostPath entries which need to exist on all hosts. In particular:

Assuming (for example) :
BASE_PATH=/data

mysql data: ${BASE_PATH}/mysql

seldon cli/shell configuration data:
CONF_DATA_PATH=${BASE_PATH}/conf

td-agent logs store:
${BASE_PATH}/seldon-data

Spark seldon models data:
${BASE_PATH}/seldon-models

These Volumes can be edited manually for custom cluster setups.

2. Create Kubernetes cluster and ensure appropriate Volumes exist

3. Start services : <TO BE FINISHED>
(a) start core services
(b) setup conf with seldon-cli if needed for example client
(c) start seldon-servers
