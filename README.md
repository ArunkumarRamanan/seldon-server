# Seldon Server

This is an early release of the Seldon Server which provides the real-time REST API interface for Seldon predictions. We are presently modifying it heavily and will provide further docs soon.

The best place to get started with Seldon is to use our packaged Virtual Machine by [signing up for the beta program](http://www.seldon.io/open-source) and dowloading the [Vagrant VM](http://docs.seldon.io/vm.html) or using the [AWS AMI](http://docs.seldon.io/vm-aws.html).
